# Overview

The project contains 2 extensions that might be helpful when You want to use some of the secret management solutions from https://github.com/LogMeIn/secret-usage-examples-guides . After installation and configuration, selecting a text in the IDE and asking for Quick fixes will provide options to put the selected string in secret management solutions. In the background, the extension will put the string into the selected solution and will generate a getter function that will return with the string. Some tweaking might be needed, like adding or removing an await, depending on the use case.

For more details, see the IDE specific README.md-s.
